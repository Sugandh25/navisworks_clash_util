# Navisworks Clash Utility

Welcome to Navisworks Clash Utility.

It is our hope that this will be a first step in helping to bridge the gap between Navisworks clash detetection and actually having useful reporting of data.

This tool will group together clashes within a set distance around each clash on the x, y, or z axis, eliminating the need to browse through thousands of clashes in a clash report.  The distance from the clash can be set by the user. Data can then be exported to a csv file.
