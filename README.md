# Navisworks Clash Utility

Welcome to Navisworks Clash Utility.

It is our hope that this will be a first step in helping to bridge the gap between Navisworks clash detetection and actually having useful reporting of data.

This tool will group together clashes within a set distance around each clash on the x, y, or z axis, eliminating the need to browse through thousands of clashes in a clash report.  The distance from the clash can be set by the user. Data can then be exported to a csv file.

### Directions (for non-developers)

You have two options.  One would be to install Python.  Do do that check out (http://www.pythong.org) and install Python 2.7.

If you donâ€™t want to install Python on your local machine you can also use a very nicely packaged virtual machine. Instructions for that approach below.

1. Download Oracle VM VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. Set up Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/)

3. Clone this repository to your machine

4. Begin using the Clash Utility in conjunction with Navisworks
